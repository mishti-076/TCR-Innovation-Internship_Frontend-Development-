            <h2>Los Angeles</h2>
            <p>
                Los Angeles is the second largest city in the United States and the largest city in
                California. LA is a sprawling metropolis full of movie stars, wannabe actors, musicians, 
                surfers, and lots of traffic. Some of the metro areas that include Santa Monica and Venice
                tend to be more popular among travelers as they are closer to the beach and have cheaper 
                accommodation. Los Angeles takes some getting used to. It’s a love/hate city for most people.
                You’ll need a car as there isn’t any widespread public transportation which makes it difficult
                to get around. The heavy traffic is typically the main thing people hate the most, so if you can 
                get past that, you can see what makes LA such a special city. Budget hotel prices – You can find a
                room in a budget hotel starting around $65 per night.

            <h2>New York</h2>
            <p>New York is probably the most visited city in the United States.
                Famous for fashion, nightlife, art, food, and theater, to me, 
                New York is the heart of the world. Every culture, language, and
                food is represented here. In New York you'll find The Met which is one of the world's
                most famous art museums, and the Guggenheim Museum which is also extremely well-known.
                Aside from art, New York is also home to the American Museum of Natural History which is
                also extremely famous.
